## Quickly Start

### Clone repository

```cmd
git clone -b single https://github.com/JohnScotttt/GraduationDesign.git
```

### Create new Python environment

You can use Conda or Venv to create a new clean Python environment to ensure that the program runs correctly. 

**We strongly recommend that you do so!ðŸ¥°**

### Install Pytorch

We recommend that you install PyTorch version 2.3.0 or higher, and ensure that the CUDA version is greater than 12.1.

You can check [PyTorch's official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) for installation guides.

### Install requirements

```cmd
cd GraduationDesign
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Generate datalist

You can add the following code to your Python file:

```python
from utils.preprocessing import generate_datalist
generate_datalist(dataset_path, dataset_name, output_dir)
```

### Train with default config

```cmd
python train.py
```

You need to modify the ***train_tsv_file*** and ***eval_tsv_file*** in **cfg/default.toml**.

### Enhance low-light images using pre-trained model

You can add the following code to your Python file:

```python
from modules.runner import eval
eval(config_file, model_path, save_images)
```
